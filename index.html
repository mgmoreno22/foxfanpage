        <p>Foxes are canines that took advantage of a missing feline evolutionary niche. They have many features and habits that are similar to wild cats, but almost completely fall into the canine evolutionary line.</p>
        <p>Some have wondered what sounds foxes make. They're capable of many types of squeaks, barks, and are even capable of laughing. However, one sound that many don't know about is a very human-like yell.</p>
